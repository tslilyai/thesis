This thesis is based off prior work on \sys published at SOSP 2023~\cite{edna}.
I am immensely grateful to my collaborators on \sys over the many years: Hannah
Gross, Eddie Kohler, Malte Schwarzkopf, and Frans Kaashoek. Without you all,
\sys would not exist today.
%
I would also like to thank Akshay Narayan, Anish Athalye, Aurojit Panda, Derek
Leung, Gohar Irfan Chaudhry, Henry Corrigan-Gibbs, James Mickens, Kevin Liao,
Kinan Dak Albab, Matthew Lentz, Nick Young, Nickolai Zeldovich, MIT's PDOS
group, Brown's ETOS group, the SystemsResearch@Google Team, and all our
anonymous reviewers: you generously donated your time and insights that greatly
improved \sys.

%
While working on \sys, I am grateful to have had the support of an NSF Graduate
Research Fellowship.  CloudLab~\cite{cloudlab} also provided essential resources
to develop the \sys prototype and evaluate its artifact.
%
Work on \sys was also supported by NSF awards CNS-2045170 and CSR-1704376, a
Google Research Scholar award, and funding from VMware.

\sys and this thesis would not have been possible without the many people whose
insights, support, generosity, and kindness have carried me throughout the past
six-plus years.
%
I thank you all not just for \sys, but also for encouraging me to be better in
all ways: as a thinker, a collaborator, a friend, and a human being.

I would especially like to thank:
