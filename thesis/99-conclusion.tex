\todo{Better conclusion, more broad about disguised data}
%
\sys enables developers to provide data \xxing and revealing
transformations that give users control over their data in web applications.
%
These transformations help users protect inactive accounts, selectively dissociate
personal data from public profiles, and remove a web service's access to their
data without permanently losing their accounts.
%

%
We used \sys to add seven \xxing transformations to three web applications, and
found that the effort required was reasonable, that \sys's \xxing and
revealing operations are fast enough to be practical, and that they impose
little overhead on normal application operation.

\sys is open-source at \url{https://github.com/tslilyai/edna}.
