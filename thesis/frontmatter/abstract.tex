Many users today have tens to hundreds of accounts with web services that store
sensitive data, from social media to tax preparation and e-commerce
sites~\cite{tens,hundreds,password_life_cycle}.
%
And while users now have the right to delete their data (via \eg the
GDPR~\cite{eu:gdpr} or CCPA~\cite{ccpa}), users want and deserve more nuanced
controls over their data that don't exist today.
%
For example, a user might wish to hide
and protect data of an e-commerce or dating app profile when inactive, but also
want their data to be present should they return to use the application. 
%
Today, however, services often provide only coarse-grained, blunt tools that
result in all-or-nothing exposure of usersâ€™ private information.
%

%
This thesis introduces the notion of \emph{disguised data}, a reversible state
of data in which sensitive data is selectively hidden.
%
This thesis then describes \sys---the first system for disguised data---which
helps web applications allow users to remove their data without permanently
losing their accounts, anonymize their old data, and selectively dissociate
personal data from public profiles.
%
\sys helps developers support these features while maintaining application
functionality and referential integrity via \emph{disguising} and \emph{revealing}
transformations.
%
Disguising selectively renders user data inaccessible via encryption, and
revealing enables the user to restore their data to the application.
%
\sys's techniques allow transformations to compose in any order, \eg deleting a
previously anonymized user's account, or restoring an account back to an
anonymized state.
