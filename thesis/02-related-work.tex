Disguised data provides flexible (and reversible) degrees of data privacy.
%\sys addresses the problem of
%reversible and composable data transformations for flexible data privacy in web
%applications.
%
Existing systems aim instead to support data deletion, prevent unauthorized data
access, or protect against database server compromise---valuable, but
complementary goals to achieving disguised data.%\sys's.

\textbf{Data deletion tools}, such as DELF at
Meta~\cite{delf} and K9DB~\cite{k9db} help correctly delete data.
%
%DELF lets developers specify deletion policies via annotations on
%social graph edges and object types, and ensures correct cascading data
%deletion.
%
%Other systems support wholesale user data deletion by tracking
%data ownership by modifying the data layout~\cite{usershards, k9db} or
%tracking information flow~\cite{schengendb}.
%
While disguised data states can provide GDPR-compliant account deletion,
disguised data also supports more nuanced use cases beyond simple deletion: for
example, \sys allows users to return after deletion, hides old data for inactive
users, or hides some but not all data so the user can continue using the
application.
%
\sys could, however, benefit from these systems' proposed techniques to track a
user's data.
%

\textbf{Policy enforcement systems} such as Qapla~\cite{qapla},
Blockaid~\cite{blockaid} and others~\cite{static, jeeves, jif, hails, ifdb,
oracle, multiverse, sieve} aim to prevent unauthorized access to data and
protect against leakage via compromised accounts or SQL injections. 
%They enforce developer-specified
%visibility and access control policies via information flow
%control~\cite{static, jeeves, jif, hails, ifdb}, authorized views~\cite{oracle},
%per-user views~\cite{multiverse}, or by blocking or rewriting database
%queries~\cite{blockaid, qapla, sieve}.
%
However, policy-enforcing systems do not help users anonymize data or maintain
application integrity constraints, which is the explicit
goal of disguised data.
%
Database contents of data under disguise is also modified so sensitive data (the
data under disguise) is no longer available in the database, and thus
unavailable even to the service itself. This is unlike policy enforcement
systems, which can deny access to sensitive data, but will still retain it in the database.
%

\textbf{Encrypted storage systems} such as CryptDB~\cite{cryptdb} and
Mylar~\cite{mylar} protect against database server compromise, with some
limitations~\cite{grubbs}.
%
%These systems encrypt data in the database, and
%ensure that only users with access to the right keys can decrypt the data.
%
%Applications must handle keys, and send queries
%either through trusted proxies that decrypt data~\cite{cryptdb}, or move
%application functionality client-side~\cite{mylar}.
%
Encrypted databases have orthogonal goals to systems for disguised data: while they protect data at all times
against attackers who do not have the keys, encrypted databases do not help applications
anonymize or temporarily remove data, which systems for disguised data do.
%
Any user with legitimate access can view the data in an encrypted database,
whereas \xxed data is removed from the database.

\textbf{Other related work} uses crytographic or systems security methods to
prove enforcement of user-defined policies~\cite{zeph, riverbed}, or explores
new decentralized paradigms for web application operation~\cite{solid, bstore,
databox, diy, amber, oort, w5, blockstack}.  These may restrict application
functionality, whereas a system for disguised data can leave the data and business models unchanged.
% TODO vanish, single-device mobile data encryption
%
%%
%{Devices} using iOS~\cite{applesecurity},
%Android~\cite{applesecurity}, or CleanOS~\cite{cleanos} revoke
%data access via encryption, like \sys does.
%%
%However, these systems operate in settings that store only a single user's data;
%\sys instead tackles the problem of
%transformations that operate over multiple users' data and shared data without
%breaking the application.
%%
%
%%
%Vanish~\cite{vanish} provides users with self-destructing data and a {proof of
%data deletion} using decentralized infrastructure and cryptographic techniques
%(with limitations against Sybil attacks~\cite{defeat_vanish}). Unlike
%\sys, Vanish cannot restore deleted data and requires extensive application
%restructuring.
%%
%
%%
%{Sypse~\cite{sypse}} pseudonymizes user data and partitions
%personally identifying information (PII) from other data. Instead of
%partitioning data, \sys modifies the database and stores \xxed data
%encrypted.
%%
%
%{Decentralized platforms} such as Solid~\cite{solid}, BSTORE~\cite{bstore},
%Databox~\cite{databox}, and others~\cite{diy, amber, oort, w5, blockstack} put
%data directly under user control, since users store their own data.
%%
%But decentralized platforms burden users with maintaining infrastructure, lack
%the capacity for server-side compute, and break today's ad-based
%business model.
%%
%By contrast, \sys leaves the data and business models unchanged,
%and stores all data, including \xxed data, on the application's servers.
%%
%
%Some platforms can prove that server-side processing respects
%{user-defined policies} via cryptographic means~\cite{zeph} or
%systems security mechanisms~\cite{riverbed}. This may restrict feasible
%application functionality (\eg to additively homomorphic functions), or restrict
%combining data with different policies. \sys protects data only after
%\xxing, but allows unrestricted application functionality before
%\xxing.
