%
We now describe how \sys's API and \xx specifications work via a \xxing transformation for Lobsters~\cite{lobsters}.
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Example: Lobsters Topic Anonymization}
\label{s:design:lobsters}

Lobsters~\cite{lobsters} is a link-sharing and discussion platform with 15.4k
users.
%
Its database schema consists of stories, tags on stories, comments, votes,
private messages, user accounts, and other user-associated metadata.
%
Users create accounts, submit URLs as stories, and interact with other users
and their posted stories via comment threads and votes.
%

Consider \textbf{topic-based anonymization}, which allows users to
hide their interest in a topic (a ``tag'' in Lobsters) by decorrelating
their comments and removing their votes on stories with that tag.
%
For instance, a Lobsters user Bea who posts about their interests---Rust,
static analysis, and Star Wars---might want to hide associations with
Star Wars before sharing their profile with potential employers.
%
This is currently not possible in Lobsters.

%
The Lobsters developer can realize topic-based anonymization as a \xxing
transformation.
% that anonymizes Bea's contributions in the database, while allowing
% Bea to later edit and reclaim them if desired.
%
First, the developer writes a \xx specification (\S\ref{s:spec})
and provides it to \sys.
%
They also add frontend code and UI elements that allow authenticated users to
trigger the \xxing transformation (Figure~\ref{f:lobsters_hook}).
%
When Bea wants to anonymize their contributions on content tagged ``Star Wars'',
Lobsters invokes \sys with a \xx specification that instructs \sys to
decorrelate comments and remove votes on ``Star Wars'' stories
(\S\ref{s:applying}).

%We focus here on a Lobsters \xxing transformation for \emph{topic-based anonymization}.
% and \emph{GDPR-compliant account removal}.
%
%Our Lobsters integration additionally supports three other transformations---account decay,
%GDPR-compliant account removal, and Lobster's current, non-GDPR-compliant account removal
%policy---as \xxing transformations (\S\ref{s:cs:lobsters}).

    pseudocode), which decorrelates comments and removes votes on stories with

\label{f:spec}
\end{figure}

%For every \xxing transformation, the developer writes a \xx specification
%(Figure~\ref{f:spec})
\noindent
\Xx specifications tell \sys what application data objects to \xx and how to \xx them.
%
A \xx specification identifies objects by database table name, principal, and
predicate, where a predicate is a SQL \fn{WHERE} clause.
%
\sys by default \xxs all objects related to the given principal, as defined by
a foreign-key relationship provided in the \xx specification (using
\texttt{principal\_fk}), but predicates can narrow the transformation's scope
(\eg to stories with specific tags).
%
For each selected group of objects, developers choose to
\emph{remove}, \emph{modify}, or \emph{decorrelate} them.
%, replacing some or all of their contents with placeholder values;
%or \three{} \emph{decorrelate} them.
%where decorrelation removes associations between principals and objects and
%re-associates the objects with pseudoprincipals. \hmng{this is a pretty verabtim
%repetition from section 3, remove or condense I'd say?}
%
The example specification in Figure~\ref{f:spec} decorrelates all comments and removes all
votes on stories with a particular tag, specified by the \texttt{TAG} parameter provided
at invocation time.

%
%or a custom set of objects specified by the \xxing transformation.
%\lyt{skipping the ``custom set of objects''; that seems unclear to me.}
%

To ensure that decorrelation preserves referential integrity, \sys generates
pseudoprincipals to replace the original principal.
%
Decorrelation can use pseudoprincipals at different granularities.
In the extreme, the \xx specification may tell \sys to create a unique
pseudoprincipal for each decorrelated application object.
In our example, however, all comments by the same user on the same story
decorrelate to the same pseudoprincipal (\verb+"group_by": "stories.id"+), thus
keeping same-story comment threads intact.
%
The same user's comments on different stories, however, decorrelate to different
pseudoprincipals; an alternative might group comments by
\texttt{comments.user\_id}, so a single pseudoprincipal adopts all of a user's
\fn{TAG}-related comments (effectively creating a ``Star Wars'' throwaway account).

 Developers can inform \sys to, upon revealing, check for any objects
added after disguising that refer to pseudoprincipals; for example, a
decorrelated comment might have new responses. This enables \sys to preserve
referential integrity for data referring to pseudoprincipals. \sys
provides three options if it finds such objects: \one{} change the object's
reference to point to the original principal; \two{} delete the object; and
\three{} continue referring to the pseudoprincipal.

% Applications can use \sys to generate pseudoprincipals, or
% % by telling \sys which
% % table to put pseudoprincipals into and how to generate each column of the table
% % (\eg constants, random emails, etc.). Alternatively, applications
% %
% can generate pseudoprincipals themselves and
% provide \sys with these pseudoprincipals' unique IDs.
%
%
%
%
% E: these points do not seem central
%
%% Pseudoprincipals may be observably different from \emph{natural
%% principal}---human application users---at the application level.
%% %
%% The application only needs to register natural principals with \sys, since
%% \sys handles pseudoprincipal creation.
%
%
%
% In our Lobsters specification, \sys generates pseudoprincipals with random
% usernames and emails in the \fn{users} table.


% Like natural principals, pseudoprincipals have affiliated public keys and
% credentials that \sys uses to \xx or reveal their data; this
% supports the composition of \xxing transformations (\S\ref{s:composition}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{\Xxing}
\label{s:applying}

To apply a \xxing transformation, \sys creates a unique \emph{\xx ID} and
queries for the data to \xx based on the \xx specification predicates.
%\lyt{Selecting all
%predicated data prior to performing database modifications ensures that
%any updates during \xxing do not affect what data to \xx. (put as footnote?
%cut? dunno)}
%
\sys then performs the specified database changes by first applying all
removals, and then decorrelations and modifications in specification order,
potentially generating and storing pseudoprincipals.
%If \sys must apply more than one change to the same selected data object
%attribute (\eg because the object satisfies multiple predicates), \sys applies
%the changes in the order specified in the spec.
%
%The developer can reason about which objects are \xxed based on the state of
%the database at the point of time the \xxing transformation occurs.
%

%
\sys next generates \emph{diff records} that contain the original data, the
changes the disguise made to the original data (\eg the value of any modified
columns), and the \xx ID.
%
For each new pseudoprincipal, \sys generates a public--private keypair and a
\emph{speaks-for record} that contains a pair of (original principal,
pseudoprincipal) IDs and the pseudoprincipalâ€™s
private key. \sys registers the pseudoprincipal with its public key to enable
composition of disguises (\S\ref{s:composition}).
%
\sys then encrypts diff and speaks-for records---collectively called
\emph{\xx records}---with the principal's key, and stores them in the database.
%
%
%
Finally, \sys returns the \xx ID to the application.
%
A client can use the \xx ID and the principal's
credentials to reveal the transformation later.
%

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics{figs/lobsters_catanon_visual}
\caption{When \sys applies topic-based anonymization to Bea's comments on stories tagged
  ``Star Wars'' (red), these comments are decorrelated to pseudoprincipals (``AnonPig'',
  ``AnonFox'') and \sys stores encrypted speaks-for records mapping Bea to their pseudoprincipals.}
\label{f:lobsters_visual}
\end{figure}


%
To perform Bea's topic-based anonymization (Figure~\ref{f:lobsters_visual}),
\sys thus:
%
\one{} queries the database to fetch comments and votes by Bea
affiliated with ``Star Wars'';
%
\two{} creates a pseudoprincipal (\eg
``AnonFox'') for every ``Star Wars''-tagged story that Bea commented
on, and inserts it as a new user;
% into the database;
%
\three{} modifies the database by rewriting comment
foreign keys to point to the created pseudoprincipals, and
removing Bea's votes on those stories;
%
\four{} creates speaks-for records that map Bea to the created
pseudoprincipals, diff records containing Bea's votes on
``Star Wars'' stories, and diff records that document Bea's original
ownership of ``Star Wars''-tagged comments;
%
\five{} encrypts the speaks-for and diff records with Bea's public key, stores
them; and
%
\six{} returns a unique \xx ID to the application.

%
% \sys's security properties require that \xx records be untraceable: even a
% complete dump of \sys's state should not allow an attacker to match \xx records
% with users.
% %
% But efficient revealing requires there be a way to reference the records for a
% given \xx transformation and principal.
% %
% To this end, \sys encrypts both \xx records \emph{and} references to \xx
% records using principal public keys, which we describe next.
%
%We now describe how this works.
%

\sys adds a \emph{\xx table} and a \emph{principal table} to the application
database to store principals' \xxed data.
%
The \xx table contains lists of per-principal \xx records encrypted with the
principal's public key.
%(Recall that private keys are not stored in the database.)
%; for instance, \verb+\xx_table[1]+ might be a list of \xx records
%pertaining to Bea's \xxing of ``Star Wars'' comments.
%
%These records are encrypted
%by Bea's public key, and thus can only be decrypted when Bea's private key is
%available.
%
The principal table is indexed by application user ID; each row contains the
principal's public key, and a list of \xx table indexes encrypted with the
public key.
%
To store \xx records for principal $p$, \sys \one{} encrypts the records with
$p$'s public key; \two{} stores the ciphertext in the \xx table under index
\fn{idx}; \three{} encrypts \fn{idx} (salted to
prevent rainbow table attacks) with $p$'s public key; and \four{} appends the
encrypted \fn{idx} to $p$'s list of encrypted \xx tables indexes
in the principal table.
%an encrypted $[i \parallel \text{random-nonce}]$ (encrypted with the principal's public key).
%encrypts $[i \parallel \text{random-nonce}]$ with the principal's public
%key and appends the result to its principal table record.

%
This allows \sys to store records without needing access to the principal's
private key, and to do so securely: the principal table adds a layer of
indirection from user ID to encrypted \xx records, so an attacker cannot link
principals to their records.
%
At reveal time, \sys can efficiently find \xxed data for a given user
by decrypting and using \xx table indexes in the principal table.
%
%This also hides from an attacker which \xxed data belongs to a given principal
%because entries in the principal table cannot be interpreted without
%principals' private keys, which are not stored in the database.
%

%
\Xxing transformations may completely remove a principal from the
application database.
%
When this happens, \sys moves the corresponding list of encrypted \xx table
indexes from the principal table to a \emph{deleted principal table} indexed
opaquely, \eg by the public key.
%
This removes the user ID from the database while allowing future reveal
operations by the principal to find their \xx table indexes.
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Revealing}
\label{s:reveal}

%
To apply a reveal transformation, \sys first locates and decrypts the
corresponding \xx records using a \xx ID and the userâ€™s \emph{reveal
credentials}.
%
\sys supports two forms of reveal credentials: \one{} the principal's private key
itself; or \two{} the principal's application password or a recovery
token (in case they forget their password), either of which \sys can use to rederive
the private key.
%
%\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
%    \item the principal's private key itself; or
%    \item backup secrets created at principal registration time.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%
%
Developers can use either or both of these credentials depending on application needs.
%
In our Lobsters example, \sys rederives the user's private key using their password.
%
% To support forgetful users, Lobsters could use a backup token.
% secret stored with a third party as a recovery token;
%
% users who forget their passwords would authenticate to this third party to
% retrieve their Lobsters token, and provide it to \sys to rederive the relevant
% private key.
%
Password or keypair changes require an application to re-register the user with
\sys, which generates new recovery tokens and re-encrypts the user's \xxed data.
%
%Alternatively, the application may keep password-encrypted private keys; users
%authenticate with their password to the application, but the application provides the decrypted
%private key to \sys as the reveal credential.
%\sys can thus flexibly support the various common user authorization protocols used by applications
%today.
%
%Users can use their password (the common case), just as they would need to in order to access the
%application.
%
%The application can give the user the backup credential to store locally, or can send it to a
%trusted third party that the user can retrieve from if the user forgets their password.
%
%Finally, the application can simply let the user use their private key directly if they wish.

%
%Using passwords as credentials renders the encryption on the users data only as secure as the user's
%password, but maintains good usability as users can use their application password to reveal data.

    records of pseudoprincipals created by other disguising transformations
    if necessary (\S\ref{s:composition}).}
  \label{f:revealpseudo}
\end{figure}

\sys's reveal procedure (Figure~\ref{f:revealpseudo}) first looks up all \xx
records related to the provided reveal credentials via \sys's principal and \xx
tables.
%
\sys then applies diff records created for the \verb+disgID+ \xx transformation
to the database, thus restoring the relevant
application objects to their pre-\xxed state.
% Additionally, \sys recursively applies the procedure for
% pseudoprincipals that the current user speaks-for; this supports the
% composition of \xxing transformations, such as a Lobsters user who removes
% their previously-anonymized contributions (\S\ref{s:composition}).

%
To preserve referential integrity, \sys first restores \xxed data that was
removed.
%
\sys then reveals any modifications, and finally performs recorrelations using
decrypted speaks-for records.
%
Finally, \sys de-registers any pseudoprincipal who no longer has any associated
disguised data, removing them from the principal table and the application's
users table.
%
Developers can configure \sys to also check for references to pseudoprincipals
prior to removing them, and depending on the application's needs, configure \sys
to delete, rewrite, or leave the references in place.
%
After revealing, the \xxed data is no longer needed, so \sys clears the
corresponding \xx records.
%


%
\sys's reveal semantics rely on consistency checks to handle
database changes (\eg application updates to un\xxed data).
%
\sys reveals data only if revealed data: \one{} will still satisfy uniqueness and
primary key constraints; \two{} will not overwrite modifications that occurred
while data was \xxed; and \three{} will maintain referential integrity.

For \one{}, \sys checks that \emph{removed} \xxed data is still removed from the
database;
%
and for \two{}, \sys ensures that \emph{modified} \xxed data is in the same
modified state and \emph{decorrelated}
\xxed data is still affiliated with the same pseudoprincipal in the database
using the new value stored in the diff record.
%
To ensure \three{}, \sys checks for the existence of all objects referenced by the data to reveal
(\eg a post referenced by a to-be-revealed comment).
%and ensures that any foreign
%key references to pseudoprincipals to be deleted are rewritten to the original.

\sys is conservative and will never reveal rows for which checks fail; the
affected data remains \xxed.
%\sys could flag encountered conflicts, giving the application a chance to fix
%them so a later reveal can pass the checks.
%Furthermore, \sys's consistency checks
%only check static invariants associated with database contents, and
%may still restore content that violate newly introduced
%application invariants since the time of disguising.
%\hmng{This comes a bit out of the blue if you're not anticipating this exact problem, I'd add an example maybe?}
%, for example if all posts of a social media site had been scrubbed of a selection of swear words.
\S\ref{s:disc} describes ways to increase the scope of \sys's checks.

%This ensures referential integrity and adherence to column uniqueness constraints.

%
In the example, if Bea wants to reveal their ``Star Wars'' contributions,
Lobsters invokes \sys with the \xx ID and Bea's password as reveal credentials.
%to reveal their Star Wars \xxing transformation.
%
\sys uses the password to reconstruct Bea's private key, retrieve and decrypt
Bea's \xx records, and filter those records for those with the \xx ID.
%
\sys then restores deleted votes and Bea's ownership of
decorrelated comments.
%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Shared Data}
\label{s:shared}
%
Many applications support shared data; in Lobsters, for example, messages
between users are owned by both users.
%or co-authored papers in HotCRP.
%
\sys's default semantics for shared data implement an ownership model inspired
by a common treatment of messages.
%
When a user \xxs shared data, \sys decorrelates the data from the \xxing user,
but preserves the data and its association with other owners.
%
\sys removes the data once all users have \xxed it and all ownership links are
to pseudoprincipals.
%
For instance, consider a Lobsters message between Bea and Chris: after Bea \xxs
the message, the message is owned by Chris and a pseudoprincipal; if Chris then
\xxs the message, \sys removes it.
%
Either owner can reveal the message, which restores the message to the database
and recorrelates the revealing user.
%
Regardless of the reveal order, if all owners reveal the message, \sys returns
the message to its original state.
%

\section{Authenticating As Pseudoprincipals}

As described so far, if Bea wanted to modify a decorrelated ``Star Wars''
comment, they would have to reveal the comment, edit it using their normal
credentials, and then re\xx the comment.
%
\sys applications can also let users modify decorrelated records without
the reveal step.
%
To support this, an application accepts reveal credentials along with a
modification request. \sys uses these credentials to validate that the
user speaks-for a specific pseudoprincipal, and updates the
database with the modification.
%its \xx records
%
%previous diff records to reflect the newly modified state.
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Security Discussion}
\label{s:eval-security}

%
%We now analyze what security \sys's design provides.
%
\sys's design achieves confidentiality of disguised data between the time of
disguising and revealing, its key goal.
%
Some aspects of \sys's design help make \sys practical and deployable without
major application modifications, but give up stronger security in exchange for
usability.
%

%Because \sys encrypts \xxed data, \sys achieves:
%lyt: I didn't like this because we already talk about encrypting disguised data
%below, and this is only a subset of WHY Edna achieves these security guarantees
%
Under \sys's threat model, \sys achieves:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item confidentiality of disguised data, via encrypting disguised data using asymmetric encryption, so only the owning userâ€™s private key can reveal it;
    \item confidentiality of which encrypted disguised data belongs to which
        user, via opaque, encrypted indexing to reference a userâ€™s disguised data; and
    \item reduced linkability between parts of a user's data, via splitting data ownership among pseudoprincipals.
\end{enumerate}
%
However, an attacker sees all application database
content and code, and \sys's \xx, principal, and deleted principal tables.
%
Thus, what the attacker learns includes:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item any un\xxed data in the application database;
  \item the active principals that have \xxed data, via \sys's principal
      table;
  \item the pseudoprincipals currently registered, from \sys's
    principal table and the application DB;
  \item the number of deleted principals, via the size of the deleted
    principal table;
  \item the amount of \xxed data in \sys; and
  \item the \xx specifications, from application code.
\end{enumerate}

%
\sys provides decorrelation with pseudoprincipals to ease integration with
existing applications, even though pseudoprincipals (and their mere existence) can
reveal information to the attacker.
%
Pseudoprincipals preserve application data and referential integrity, ensuring that
\eg every post always has an author, or that vote counts on posts remain unchanged,
without requiring the developer to handle special cases of deleted users and
orphaned data.
%
However, this necessarily leaves information in the database.
% that an attacker could use.
%

Similarly, leveraging the application database to store \xxed data increases \sys's
practicality as it reuses existing server-side storage and avoids burdening
users with managing their disguised data, but leaves potentially
exploitable metadata available to attackers.
%
An attacker could leverage pseudoprincipal groupings (\eg a pseudoprincipal
owning posts in both ``CMU 2018'' and ``BayArea'' topics), un\xxed data
(\eg comments signed with the user's name), and \sys metadata (\eg that some
anonymous user has more \xxed data than another, as \sys stores \xxed data without
padding for efficiency) to infer the identity of the original owning principal.

Finally, \sys makes no guarantees for users who actively use \xxed data after
compromise (\eg by revealing or editing decorrelated data): after an attacker
compromises the application at time $t$, they can harvest private keys that
clients provide after $t$.
%
However, \sys always protects users' \xxed data if they remain inactive.
%
%%Likewise, when a client provides $(\lcapa{pd}, p, d)$ to operate over data under
%%disguise, the attacker learns the correspondence between \lcapa{pd} and $(p, d)$.
%
%%But this merely makes the attack more efficient, as the attacker can already discover
%%$p$'s disguise history by attempting to decrypt all bags with $p$'s private key.
%
%However, the attacker cannot gain access to any previously-revealed data that users
%subsequently removed from the application database.
%

%
%: viable protections (\eg storing
%\xxed data externally, \xxing all user data, or padding \xx records and
%pseudoprincipal counts) can break application functionality by removing too much
%data, prevent further \xxing of pseudoprincipal-owned data, and result in
%prohibitively expensive space costs.
%
%\lyt{This could let us cut the disc..}

%
%The attacker could also try to leverage remaining data in the application
%database, the size of the \xxed data, and the number of registered
%pseudoprincipals for a statistical inference attack that lets them conclude
%which pseudoprincipals likely correspond to a natural principal.
%%
%\sys does not protect against such attacks: viable protections would break the
%application for others by removing too much data from the application DB and
%require expensive padding of \xxed data and the pseudoprincipal count.
%%

%as the cost of the necessary protections would be
%prohibitive: \sys would have to add padding to every bag and pseudoprincipal locator set, and the
%amount of padding would need to be proportional to the largest amount of data any natural principal
%holds in the application DB (see \S\ref{s:disc}).
%
%However, \sys guarantees that the attacker cannot tell the \emph{identity} of an inactive natural
%principal correlated with some pseudoprincipal(s) based on the compromised information, since the
%natural principal has been removed from the application DB and from \sys's metadata.


%We note that our threat model puts privilege-escalation and root privilege attacks out of scope:
%thus, an adversary cannot observe privilege-protected query logs or other database metadata that
%would potentially leak \xxed data~\cite{grubbs}. While \sys provides no guarantees for
%root-privilege attacks, \sys increases the difficulty of extracting \xxed data. \lyt{Move
%this last paragraph somewhere?}

%\textbf{Security of Reveal Credentials.}
%
%
The attacker never has access to a user's private key unless the user actively
provides their credentials.
%
The attacker also cannot access the private key of any pseudoprincipal because
it is in an encrypted speaks-for record.
%
% By induction, the attacker cannot access any private keys.
%
If an application uses password-based reveal credentials, \sys
guarantees security equivalent to the security of the user's password.
