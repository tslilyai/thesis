\noindent Brief Statement of the Problem:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm}

\noindent 
Users' privacy requirements for their sensitive data on web applications are
highly contextual and constantly in flux.
%
But today, achieving this flexible privacy remains out of reach, in part because
of the many challenges facing web developers in building services that can adapt
to changing privacy needs. 
%
This thesis identifies the need for new systems that help developers support
automated, fine-grained controls over user data that provide users with flexible
privacy. To address the challenges associated with flexible privacy in web applications,
this thesis introduces Edna, a system that helps web developers realize
\emph{disguised} data, a new state of user data that bridges the gap between
permanently deleted data, and data left accessible and vulnerable to the
application.
\end{minipage}

\noindent Supervision Agreement:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm}
\noindent The program outlined in this proposal is adequate for a PhD thesis. The
supplies and facilities required are available, and I am willing to supervise
the research and evaluate the thesis report.
