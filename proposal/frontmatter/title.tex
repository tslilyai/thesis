\noindent Brief Statement of the Problem:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm}

\noindent Users today have little to no control over the data they give to web
applications.  They must either avoid using an application, or leave their data
susceptible to leaks, \eg via SQL injections or compromise of other users'
accounts.  Incentivized by growing public demand and laws such as the GDPR and
CCPA~\cite{eu:gdpr, ccpa}, developers increasingly need to implement mechanisms
to give users control over their dataâ€™s exposure.

\end{minipage}

\vspace{1em}
\noindent Supervision Agreement:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm}
\noindent The program outlined in this proposal is adequate for a PhD thesis. The
supplies and facilities required are available, and I am willing to supervise
the research and evaluate the thesis report.
