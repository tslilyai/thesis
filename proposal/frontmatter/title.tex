\noindent Brief Statement of the Problem:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm}

\noindent 
Users today give up control of their data to web services in order to use these services. This puts user data at risk of data breaches and exposes it to third parties in ways unwelcome or unknown to the user. Incentivized by recent legal developments such as the GDPR and CCPA, as well as growing public demand, developers increasingly need to implement better user controls in their web applications.
%
However, doing so is challenging: the data that users want to protect is often
    important for the service’s function. This thesis explores Edna, a new system
    design that helps applications navigate the gray space where users’ need for
    data protection and application functionality requirements overlap.

\noindent Supervision Agreement:

\vspace{1em}
\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm}
\noindent The program outlined in this proposal is adequate for a PhD thesis. The
supplies and facilities required are available, and I am willing to supervise
the research and evaluate the thesis report.
