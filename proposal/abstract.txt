Users’ privacy requirements for their sensitive data on web applications are
highly contextual and constantly in flux. But today, achieving this flexible
privacy remains out of reach, in part because of the many challenges facing web
developers in building services that can adapt to changing privacy needs.
Consequently, services often provide only coarse-grained, blunt tools that result in all-or-nothing exposure of users’ private information.

This thesis identifies the need for new systems that help developers support automated, fine-grained controls over user data that provide users with flexible privacy, and grant them more nuanced controls over their data that don’t exist today. To address the challenges associated with flexible privacy in web applications, this thesis introduces Edna, a system that helps web developers realize disguised data, a new state of user data that bridges the gap between permanently deleted data, and data left accessible and vulnerable to the application. With , users can remove their data without permanently losing their accounts, anonymize their old data, and selectively dissociate personal data from public profiles.
